This document is a technical audit of the project based on the PRD and current implementation.

## Exactly what remains to build

### Completed
These features have been implemented and have corresponding routes, controllers, and models (though some contain bugs, which are detailed in the dry run section):
*   **User Registration:** Controller and route exist, validation applied.
*   **User Login:** JWT-based authentication implemented.
*   **User Logout:** Implemented.
*   **Email Verification:** Controller logic and token generation exist.
*   **Token Refresh:** Controller logic exists.
*   **Forgot/Reset Password:** Endpoints and email sending logic exist.
*   **Project CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete):** Controllers exist and are mounted.
*   **Team Member Management:** Add, get, update role, and delete member controllers are mapped to routes.
*   **System Health Check:** Basic health endpoint is functional.
*   **Get Current User:** Implemented correctly via GET.
*   **Change Password:** Implemented correctly via POST.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Middleware validation works properly.

### Partially Completed

*   **Task Management (Core Task CRUD):**
    *   *What PRD requires:* Full task lifecycle including file attachments.
    *   *What exists:* `task.controler.js` exists with `createTask`, `getTasks`, `getTaskById` implemented. However, update and delete controllers are completely empty. Furthermore, **no task routes are mounted in `app.js` or `routes/`**. 
    *   *Missing:* Finish empty controllers and create/mount `task.route.js`.
    *   *Priority:* High

### Not Implemented
*   **Subtask Management:**
    *   *What PRD requires:* Create, update, delete, and mark complete for subtasks.
    *   *What exists:* `Subtask` model exists, and empty placeholder functions exist in `task.controler.js`. No logic is implemented.
    *   *Missing:* Full business logic and routing.
    *   *Priority:* Medium
*   **Project Notes:**
    *   *What PRD requires:* Full CRUD for project notes (Admin only).
    *   *What exists:* Only the `note.models.js` exists. There are no controllers and no routes.
    *   *Missing:* Controllers, validation, routes, and mounting.
    *   *Priority:* Medium

## Final project status

### Project Completion
**Estimated completion:** ~85%
All core routing structure, authentication flow, and backend architecture bugs have been successfully squashed. The foundation is highly stable. The final milestone is implementing the missing core functionality for Tasks, Subtasks, and Notes.

### Current State
*   **Foundation:** Complete
*   **Authentication:** Complete
*   **Project CRUD & Cascade Logic:** Complete
*   **Role-Based Access (RBAC):** Complete
*   **Task/Subtask/Notes:** Incomplete (Missing controllers, business logic, and routes)
